# Conor Furlong's Portfolio

## About Me
I'm a Software Engineer studying in an immersive full-time software engineering bootcamp. Prior to my SE education, I spent two years as a Content Marketer in the EdTech industry, where I worked with established educational content providers to present their brands to wider audiences. While in marketing, I created several websites alongside software engineers where I provided the copy, and they executed the design and functionality. Seeing their work, I soon discovered that I had a passion for what they do, and have since decided to pursue a career in tech for myself. My leadership skills, desire to learn, and ongoing understanding of what makes a solid application have proven to be strong motivators in my path towards a software engineering career.

## Technologies Used
My portfolio was built with React.js. It implements React routing, JavaScript, and CSS to bring it all together. 

The best portfolios I have seen are those with unique background design and darker color schemes. These, especially from former General Assembly students, were big inspirations for me as I put this together. 

## Future Features
This is only the first of many drafts. In the future, I would like my portfolio to:
- Contain all components within one page. As of now, the Home, About, and Projects pages all exist separately. In the future, I would like visitors to be able to scroll down one page to ease navigation.
- Utilize CSS more effectively. As I hone my CSS skills, I would like to see future versions, more organized, but also have more diverse styling within each section. 
- Showcase more images, animations, and unique style choices. More hover features, stylized buttons, and animated images will certainly make the portfolio stand out.
