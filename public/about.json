    "bio": "I'm a Software Engineer studying in an immersive full-time software engineering bootcamp. Prior to my SE education, I spent two years as a Content Marketer in the EdTech industry, where I worked with established educational content providers to present their brands to wider audiences. While in marketing, I created several websites alongside software engineers where I provided the copy, and they executed the design and functionality. Seeing their work, I soon discovered that I had a passion for what they do, and have since decided to pursue a career in tech for myself. My leadership skills, desire to learn, and ongoing understanding of what makes a solid application have proven to be strong motivators in my path towards a software engineering career."
